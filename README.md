# Tire Models

This repository contains multiple tire model scripts based on tire fitting tool and ```magicformula()``` function

## Things to do Before Running

1. Download tire fitting tool: [MagicFormulaTyreTool](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/111375-magic-formula-tyre-tool). 
Note: This repository contains some fitted tire data files, so you won't need this tool for those set of data.
